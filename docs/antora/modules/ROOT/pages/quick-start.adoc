:description: Get Veidly up and running in 5 minutes
:keywords: quick start, installation, setup

Get Veidly running on your local machine in just a few minutes.

== Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* **Go 1.21+** - https://golang.org/dl/[Download Go]
* **Node.js 18+** and **npm** - https://nodejs.org/[Download Node.js]
* **Git** - For cloning the repository

== Step 1: Clone the Repository

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/veidly.com.git
cd veidly.com
----

== Step 2: Start the Backend

[source,bash]
----
# Install Go dependencies
go mod download

# Initialize the database
go run . &

# The backend will start on http://localhost:8080
----

The first time you run the application, it will:

* Create the SQLite database at `/tmp/veidly.db`
* Run all database migrations
* Start the API server on port 8080

== Step 3: Start the Frontend

Open a new terminal window:

[source,bash]
----
cd frontend

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
----

The frontend will start on http://localhost:3000 and automatically open in your browser.

== Step 4: Create Test Data (Optional)

To populate the database with sample events and users:

[source,bash]
----
# From the project root directory
./seed_test_data.sh
----

This creates:

* 3 test users (including 1 admin)
* 10 sample events with various privacy settings
* Participants for some events

=== Test User Credentials

After seeding, you can log in with:

[options="header"]
|===
|Email |Password |Role
|admin@test.com |test123 |Admin (verified)
|test1@test.com |test123 |Regular user (verified)
|test2@test.com |test123 |Regular user (verified)
|===

== Step 5: Explore the Application

Now you can:

1. **View Events**: Browse events on the interactive map at http://localhost:3000
2. **Sign In**: Click "Sign In" and use one of the test credentials
3. **Create an Event**: Click "Create Event" to add your own event
4. **Join Events**: Click event markers on the map and join events
5. **Download ICS**: Export events to your calendar

== Environment Variables

For local development, you can create a `.env` file in the project root:

[source,bash]
----
# Server Configuration
PORT=8080
DB_PATH=/tmp/veidly.db

# JWT Secret (change in production!)
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-in-production

# Mailgun Configuration (optional for local dev)
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=
MAILGUN_API_KEY=
MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
----

NOTE: Email verification requires Mailgun credentials. Without them, all users will be created as unverified. Admin users can manually verify users from the admin panel.

== Next Steps

Now that you have Veidly running locally:

* Read the xref:development/setup.adoc[Development Setup] guide for detailed configuration
* Learn about xref:features/privacy.adoc[Privacy Controls] to understand the privacy features
* Review the xref:api/overview.adoc[API Documentation] to build integrations
* Check out xref:development/testing.adoc[Testing Guide] to run the test suite

== Troubleshooting

=== Backend Won't Start

**Issue**: `database is locked` error

**Solution**: Stop any existing Veidly processes:
[source,bash]
----
pkill veidly
# or
lsof -i :8080
----

**Issue**: `permission denied` on `/tmp/veidly.db`

**Solution**: Set proper permissions or use a different DB_PATH:
[source,bash]
----
export DB_PATH=./veidly.db
go run .
----

=== Frontend Won't Start

**Issue**: `EADDRINUSE` port already in use

**Solution**: Kill the process using port 3000:
[source,bash]
----
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
----

**Issue**: Module not found errors

**Solution**: Clean install dependencies:
[source,bash]
----
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
----

=== Cannot Create Events

**Issue**: "Email verification required" message

**Solution**: Either:

1. Configure Mailgun and verify your email, or
2. Use the admin account (`admin@test.com`) which bypasses verification, or
3. Manually update the database:
[source,bash]
----
sqlite3 /tmp/veidly.db "UPDATE users SET email_verified = 1 WHERE email = 'youruser@test.com';"
----
