## Running the Application

### Option 1: Run Backend and Frontend Separately

#### Terminal 1 - Start the Go backend:

```bash
# From project root
go run main.go
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`

#### Terminal 2 - Start the React frontend:

cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`

### Option 2: Use the convenience scripts

#### On Unix/Linux/macOS:

```bash
# Make scripts executable (first time only)
chmod +x run.sh

# Run both servers
./run.sh
```

#### On Windows:

```cmd
run.bat
```

6. Submit to create the event - it will appear as a marker on the map
7. Click markers to see event details in a popup

## Development Notes

- The backend includes CORS support for both Vite dev server (port 3000) and production
- SQLite database is automatically created on first run
- The map uses OpenStreetMap tiles (no API key required)
- Events are filtered to show only upcoming events
- Location coordinates can be manually edited in the form or set by clicking the map

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication and profiles
- Event RSVP system
- Event search and filtering
- Real-time notifications
- Event photos and ratings
- Mobile app
