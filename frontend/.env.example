# API Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT include /api suffix - it's added automatically in config.ts

# For development (local backend):
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

# For production (when frontend and backend are on same domain):
# Leave VITE_API_URL empty or unset - will use relative URLs
# VITE_API_URL=

# For production (when backend is on different domain):
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.veidly.com

# Note: In production builds, if VITE_API_URL is not set,
# the app will automatically use relative URLs (e.g., /api/events)
# This works when nginx serves both frontend and proxies /api/* to backend
